        <h1>New Yorkers Seek Change After Low Voter Turnout</h1>
        <p>Not many New Yorkers were registered to vote in the New York primary on April 19, and many who were faced challenges, resulting in a low voter turnout.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://mkoenig.cartodb.com/viz/3c7e5436-0ca3-11e6-bd07-0e3ff518bd15/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Only an average of 50 percent of New York’s eligible voters were registered to vote in the April 19 presidential primary, according to data from the <a href="http://www.elections.ny.gov/EnrollmentCounty.html">New York Board of Elections</a>. In several counties, problems with voter registration made this number even lower.</p>
<p>“Two million New Yorkers are not registered to vote. That’s a huge chunk of people who can’t even get in the game,” said New York City Votes Press Secretary Matt Sollars.
</p>
<p>Some who were registered, however, also faced problems voting in the recent primary. In Brooklyn, for example,  more than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/nyregion/de-blasio-calls-for-improvements-in-election-process-after-problems-in-presidential-primary.html">125 thousand</a> Democrats were dropped from the records without any explanation.</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Other counties faced similar issues.</p>
<p>“This wasn’t a uniquely Brooklyn issue,” said Katherine Brezler from the New York for Bernie Sanders campaign. “The Bronx had a similar issue, there were whole buildings not on the roll,” she said.</p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called this purge a “disgrace,” and some of his supporters believe this may have impacted how well he did in the state.
</p>
<p>“It’s a proportional delegate count and a proportion of the population did not vote,” said Brezler.</p>
<p>
Despite this belief, only 36 percent of those who were registered actually voted.</p>

<p>And even though New York Republicans were more unified behind a candidate, they also faced poor voter turnout.</p>
<div class="container"><iframe width='100%' height='520' frameborder='0' src='https://mkoenig.cartodb.com/viz/b7f90d90-0c9e-11e6-9efe-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Now, some government agencies are trying to open up the voting system. Suffolk County Executive <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-opinion-advising-legality-online-voter-registration">Steve Bellone</a> is currently pressuring the state government to enable the county to use online voter registration, which New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman endorsed.
</p>
<p>“Now that the A.G. has approved the online voter registration we are looking at ways to bring it to fruition,” said Vanessa Baird-Streeter, the director of communications at the Suffolk County Executive’s Office.</p>
<p>Other governmental organizations are pushing for statewide reform. New York City Votes, a nonpartisan branch of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, is pressuring the state to adopt three bills.</p>
<p>The first bill is the <a href="http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/A5972">Voter Empowerment Act</a>, which would create a universal online voter registration system and change the deadline for people who want to change their party affiliation to ten days before the election. For the April 19 primary, the deadline to change one’s party affiliation was in October.</p>
<p>“No other state has such an extreme deadline,” said Sollars.</p>
<p>The other two bills that New York City Votes supports would enable New Yorkers to vote <a href="http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/A8582A">earlier</a> and change the <a href="http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/A3389A">ballot laws</a> to make them easier to read.</p>
<p>Still, some government officials are worried that these changes may have negative consequences.</p>
<p>“I think that we should look to make voting a right to as many people as possible, but you also need to put in as many safeguards as possible. We do have a responsibility at the Board of Elections to protect against voter fraud,” said Nick LaLota, commissioner for the Suffolk County Board of Elections.</p>
<p>New York City Votes does not believe that these laws will result in an increase in voter fraud, however.</p>
<p>“Voter fraud is something that is brought up frequently, but is known to occur very rarely. We can bank online securely, we can shop online securely, we should be able to devise a secure system to register people to vote,” said Sollars.</p>
<p>New York City Votes will be in Albany on May 3 to deliver a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/andrew-cuomo-new-york-state-senate-new-york-state-assembly-vote-better-new-york">change.org</a> petition with 3 thousand signatures, and 15 thousand more on paper, to pass these bills through the New York State Assembly.
